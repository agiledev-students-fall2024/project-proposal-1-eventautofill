# Autofill

### What and why?

* Autofill is an event-based app where users can list and join events

* The problem this solution solves is small-scale event listing. Individuals and small-scale businesses have difficulty marketing their events often relying solely on social media. However, this app provides a new avenue for listing their events

* The word "event" is used loosely. For example, I might have a dinner reservation with a cancellation fee but one of my friends has an emergency so they must cancel. I can use the "event" lister to find a willing +1 to fill the dinner reservation. Similarly, let's say I've always wanted to go to an escape room, however, my friends don't want to. I can list this as an event on Autofill to find willing participants to join my escape room

### For whom?

* This app is built for individuals and small-scale businesses that need an avenue for listing events that require people

### How?

* From an end-user's perspective, Autofill will offer the following features:

  * __List Event__: Users can list events on the platform listing time, date, location, and other relevant event details

  * __Join Event__: Users can browse through the events and join any event that they'd like

  * __Browser Events__: Events will be listed in an organized fashion with a trending page. They can be sorted based on date, time, price, and location

  * __Notifications__: Users receive notifications notifying them of event related information such as joining

### Scope

Autofill is at the appropiate scope for 4-5 developers over the course of one semester to create a minimal viable product with the above features described. Much of the work has to do with the event listing page and its associated features.
